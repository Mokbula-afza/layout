Roger B. Chaffee (1935â€“1967) was an American naval officer and aviator, aeronautical engineer, and NASA astronaut. He was to have been a pilot on Apollo 1, but died in a fire on January 27, 1967, with fellow astronauts Gus Grissom and Ed White, during a pre-launch test for the mission. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. This photograph shows Chaffee at a console at NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston during the Gemini 3 mission on March 23, 1965.
